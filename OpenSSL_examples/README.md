# OpenSSL example files 

I need to use openSSL and thus need to find out how to implement it. I will copy from other sources in order to learn, and then I will tweak the sources to do what I need them to be able to do.

## Sources
https://aticleworld.com/ssl-server-client-using-openssl-in-c/

## COMPLETED
Certificate has been generated via commandline

## TODO
- Make the client and server from the server/client in the examples above.
